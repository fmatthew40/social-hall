 ## Description
 To start, I installed npm express.  Express.js allowed me to create and run a local server. I also installed mongoose.
 After I set up a local server with express, I set up my Thought and my User models.  I then set up my controllers.  I also added my routes.  I tested my routes with Insomnia.  

 In addition, I installed moment.js.  I used moment.js to format the dates that were returned.  

 The application will accept and return data using nosql.  The application is a social network that allows users to add friends, thoughts, and reactions.  

 ## Usage 
 The project's intended use is to act as a social network.  It is the backend of a social network.  It allows users to add friends, thoughts, and reactions.
